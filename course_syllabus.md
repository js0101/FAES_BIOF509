**BIOF509 - Applied Machine Learning with Python**

**Spring 2019**

Machine learning is a computational field that consists of techniques
allowing computers to learn from data and make data-driven predictions
or decisions. The ability to implement machine learning approaches
appropriately and intelligently is a crucial component of data analysis.
BIOF 509 provides a broad practical introduction to machine learning
concepts, analysis design, and implementation.

The course will give a broad and conceptual overview of the most popular
machine learning algorithms, followed by examples of how and when to
apply them to real data. Best practices in designing machine learning
analyses will be emphasized and reviewed, along with how to avoid common
pitfalls and how to interpret analysis results.

Through homework and in-class assignments, students will implement
machine learning models in Python, utilizing state-of-the-art machine
learning Python packages, such as scikit-learn and tensorflow.
Algorithms that will be covered include but are not limited to linear
and logistic regression, random forest, K-means clustering, and deep
learning.

Note that the course emphasizes hands-on application of algorithms, and
mathematical derivation will not be reviewed. Further, depending on the
student's familiarity with Python, completing the weekly homework
assignments can take 1-4 hours.

The course will culminate in a short research project utilizing machine
learning to analyze either the student's own dataset or a public dataset
that the student chooses.

By the end of this course you should be able to:

1.  Create data analysis programs in Python language together with
    numpy, pandas, matplotlib in Jupyter environment
2.  Describe the common types of machine learning and deep learning
    tasks
3.  Implement simple machine learning algorithms, such as linear and
    logistic regression models and clustering utilizing numpy
4.  Convert a data set into a form suitable for use by machine learning
    algorithms
5.  Choose appropriate machine learning techniques for data analyses and
    interpret their results.
6.  Properly design machine learning analysis pipelines and avoid common
    pitfalls.
7.  Complete a short research project using machine learning.

This is a 15 week course starting on the 7th February, and finishing on
the 16th of May. Classes will take place between 5:30pm and 7:30pm each
Thursday in building 60, room TBD. First class is in room 162.

Attendance in class is strongly recommended; however, we realize other
commitments will occasionally prevent attendance. Class materials will
generally be distributed over the course website.

Most classes will have hands-on tutorials and assignments. Both practice
and graded assignments will generally be provided. Graded assignments
should be submitted prior to the following class, please follow the
deadlines specified on OKpy website. So that you can follow along during
class bringing a laptop to each class is strongly encouraged.

Please check with the FAES regarding the last drop out day and the last
day to change status (credit or audit).

Required Materials[¶](#required-materials "Permalink to this headline"){.headerlink}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Each student is encouraged to bring their own laptop to each class.**
For the course, we will use Python 3. Any up-to-date python installation
should work, but you must be able to install packages. The Anaconda
Scientific Python Distribution from Continuum Analytics will likely be
the easiest approach to configuring python if you do not already have
python installed. The Anaconda installer will automatically install many
of the packages we will use during the course.

**There is no required textbook for this course.**

We will link to relevant online resources throughout the course.

If you would like a refresher on the basics, the following resources may
be useful:

-   [Learn python the hard way (ebook freely available from the
    author)](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/){.reference
    .external} by Zed A. Shaw. A video course is also
    [available](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/){.reference

-   [Think python (ebook freely available from the
    author)](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.html){.reference

Further material is included on the [[Week 1
page]{.doc}](../week1/index.html){.reference .internal}.

The following books cover some of the same material we will cover during
the course. These books are not required, and presented solely as an
alternative starting point covering the course objectives.

Assignments and Grading[¶](#assignments-and-grading "Permalink to this headline"){.headerlink}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The emphasis of the course is on learning and mastering the skills
covered. It is our hope that everyone will be able to complete the
assignments and project. If some of the material appears unclear please
ask on the corresponding Slack channel for clarification.

The final project is 50% of the course, with the weekly assignments
representing the remainder.

**Weekly Assignments**

Weekly assignments will generally consist of multiple components. Unless
otherwise specified, each component will be graded pass / fail. A
component will be graded as "pass" if it runs and produces the expected
results. The final grade will be equal to the percentage of components
that are graded as "pass" out of all the assignment's components.

**Final Project**

The final project will consist of the following components:

1\) *Project documentation.* Each project should have documentation
clarifying its goal and functionality. The code itself should be
well-documented, with comments spread out to aid understanding.
Functions and classes should have docstrings describing their
functionality, inputs and outputs.

2\) *Project code.* The code should be well-organized and easy to read.
It should also be written modularly, so that each part of code is
reusable. The code should run and produce the correct output under
different conditions. It should also have robust error checking.

3\) *Project presentation.* Each student will present their project at
the end of the semester. The idea here is to present the project's
goals, input, and output, preferably while showing snippets of code.

Project grades will be determined based on the components outlined
above, with each component representing 33% of the project grade.

Some guidelines for the final projects. The *most* important factor is
clarity and documentation; we need to understand what you are doing and
why you are doing it.

1.  We need to understand the problem you are trying to solve or
    explore, and your overarching goal.
2.  We need to understand your approach, in ML terms (supervised /
    unsupervised, classification / regression, clustering, etc).
    Whatever ML approach you choose, justify it in terms of your
    overarching goal and datasets.
3.  Describe your data in ML terms: what is each sample and how many are
    there, what are the features and how are they formatted, etc.
4.  Describe the workflow clearly: from raw datasets and their sources,
    to formatting and preprocessing those data into samples and
    features, through ML approaches and final results.
5.  Code should be documented with docustrings and comments, plots
    should be labelled in such a way that we know what we are looking
    at.
6.  Note that project documentation and code can be combined into a
    single Jupyter notebook, but does not have to be.
7.  While we appreciate well-written and modular code, with robust
    error-checking and so forth, this is not required. The most
    important factor is that the code is legible (docustrings, comments)
    so that we can follow.
